In our code, we create a simple Secure System that manages two subjects - Hal and Lyle - and two objects - Lobj and Hobj - that hold either a high security label or a low security label. Our code brings in an instruction list that details a series of instructions that will be carried out by our Secure System. At this point, only READ and WRITE instructions are supported. Anything that is not a READ or a WRITE is labelled as a bad instruction and will not be executed by our System. If the instruction is valid, we also check the legality of the READ or WRITE based on the Simple Security Property and the *-property. After these insturctions are executed, we print out the current state of the system based on the previously run instruction.

We have finished all the requirements.
